install this module.

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rangertheman/dw-swedish-compendia/master/module.json]

The module will configure the Dungeon World system settings for using the Swedish compendia automatically. If you import the files, please make sure to keep the item-ID, at least on the inventory lists and the tags.

!DO NOT! use this module at the same time as the Homebrew World Add-on module as this will cause a loop.

* Uninstall

When removing this module from your game world, the settings in the
"System Settings" page will remain. You can change them individually
or use the "Reset to Defaults" button at the bottom of the page to
revert everything back to it's default state in the Dungeon World
system.

Ability scores/mods will need to be updated when turning this module
on and off as well. Any content you are using from this module's
compendia should be imported to the game world so that it will not be
missing.
