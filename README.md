Dungeon World Swedish Compendia

## Description

Svenska kompendier till Asacolips Dungeon World-system till Foundry VTT. Innehåller klasser, grunddrag, spelböcker för samtliga klasser, etiketter och utrustningslistor.

An add-on module for Asacolips' Dungeon World system for Foundry VTT to add Swedish compendia to your game world. Please note that the compendia are inspired by Worlds of Adventure. All moves from the Dungeon World SRD are included. Some are not assigned to a character class, i.e. when they have been replaced by a WoA move.x

## Installation

* Install

First install the Dungeon World system, then use the following URL to
install this module.

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rangertheman/dw-swedish-compendia/master/module.json]

The module will configure the Dungeon World system settings for using the Swedish compendia automatically and will also make adjustments for the World of Adventures inspired settings.

!DO NOT! use this module at the same time as the Homebrew World Add-on module as this will cause a loop.

* Uninstall

When removing this module from your game world, the settings in the
"System Settings" page will remain. You can change them individually
or use the "Reset to Defaults" button at the bottom of the page to
revert everything back to it's default state in the Dungeon World
system.

Ability scores/mods will need to be updated when turning this module
on and off as well. Any content you are using from this module's
compendia should be imported to the game world so that it will not be
missing.
